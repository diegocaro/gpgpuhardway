# gpgpuhardway
My own hard way of learning gpgpu

I started this project for improving the performance of simulations for
growing microcolonies of bacteria.

In the first part I will cover the underlying of programming with OpenGL.
I will follow a simple, but great tutorial that covers two important
concepts in OpenGL: shaders and buffers. 
More info in https://github.com/vispy/codecamp-esrf-2014/tree/master/nr/tutorial
(tutorial by Nicolas P. Rougier http://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/)

In the second part I will simulate simple particle physics interaction.
In this part I will rewrite the WebGL version of the particle physics project 
(by Chris Wellons http://nullprogram.com/blog/2014/06/29/) to OpenGL+Python. 

In the third part ... aha!
